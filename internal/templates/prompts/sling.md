Hook work and start immediately (keep context).

Work to sling: {{bead_id}}

Execute these steps:

1. Hook the work to your session:
   `gt hook {{bead_id}}`

2. Start working on it immediately:
   `gt sling {{bead_id}}`

This attaches the work to your hook and begins execution while preserving your current context.
